# Potential and limitations: a short investigation of Power BI as a dashboard tool
This little project in Power BI is for testing the tool and its limitations. I have found suitable data used for that at a friend's repository who used bike sharing data from Deutsche Bahn ("Call a Bike", "StadtRad"). The data is accessible (here)[https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-call-a-bike].

The variables in this dataset are:
- booking, vehicle and customer id
- start datetime of booking and end datetime
- start station and end station (can be equal)
- day hour rental start and end (0-23)
- trip duration
